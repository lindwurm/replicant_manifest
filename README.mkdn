Replicant
=========

About
-----

Replicant is a fully free Android distribution running on several devices.
It is based on CyanogenMod and thus on the Android Open Source Project.

Android includes software from various sources, released under different free software licenses.
Replicant attempts to remove or replace any non-free component (running on the main CPU) that is needed by Android, whenever this is possible.

We are not experts in embedded devices, just a couple enthusiastic hackers that are giving a try.

Credits
-------

Replicant is based on CyanogenMod <http://www.cyanogenmod.com/> which is based on the Android Open Source Project <http://www.android.com/>.

Contributors
------------

The full list of contributors to the Replicant code base must be very long since it is based on CyanogenMod and AOSP, which are both using third party projects.
However, a (non-exhaustive) list of people who specifically contribute(d) to Replicant is available at: <http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/People>

    (Go to repo you are patching, make your changes and commit)
    cmgerrit <for(new)/changes(patch set)> <branch/change-id> 

    repo start cm-13.0 .
    (Make your changes and commit)

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b cm-13.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](http://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions.

For more information on this Github Organization and how it is structured, 
please [read the wiki article](http://wiki.lineageos.org/w/Github_Organization)

Buildbot
--------

All supported devices are built nightly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.

You can view the current build statuses at [LineageOS Jenkins](http://jenkins.lineageos.org/)
